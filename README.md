## Turn On The Light

Turn On The Light is a simple game that I made almost a year ago as a part of my personal project. In this game you have to turn the tiles in the correct order thereby making path for the current flow and turn on the light (which indicates the completion of that level). The levels gets harder as you progress further in the game. 


## Motivation

Well, this project was inspired by games like Energy:Anti Stress Loops and Infinity Loops. So I wanted to make my own version of those  games, gave it a try and came up with this project.


## Tech Used

 **Built with :-**
   1. HTML5
   2. CSS3
   3. JavaScript
 
 **Coded In :-**
   - Sublime Text 3
   
 
## How to Use

Just open up and random text editor and save the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files with their proper extensions and then just open the project on a web browser, it should start hopefully allowing you to play the game.
